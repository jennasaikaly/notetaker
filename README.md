  # Express.js Challenge: Note Taker  

  ## Description

  For this challenge, I had to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.  The app uses an Express.js back-end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.  I was provided with front-end starter code, so my job was to build the back-end, connect the two and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
