  # Express.js Challenge: Note Taker  

  ## Description

  For this challenge, we have to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.  The app uses an Express.js backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.  We were provided with front-end starter code, so our job was to build the back end, connect the two and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
